NOTE: Currently WIP! Only a Jupyter Notebook is available, which is still incomplete. Basic functionality for Perkin-Elmer `.fsm` files do exist already.

### Spectral data visualisation dashboard, which makes data discovery simple and interactive using Python.

Explore spectral data cubes in the browser using a Python-Holoviews dashboard. Apply common data processing techniques (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) to the data. Use the embeddings created with these processing techniques to interactively select areas in the sample data.
